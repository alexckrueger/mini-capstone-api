# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Product.create(name: "liver", price: 80, description: "Poor uncle Rick.")
# Product.create(name: "heart", price: 150, description: "It was working when I took it out")
# Product.create(name: "kidney", price: 55, description: "Can not guarantee working condition")
# Product.create(name: "brain", price: 6000, description: "When you really need to delete a memory")

# product = Product.create(name: "eyeball", price: 9, description: "an eye for an eye?")
# product.save
